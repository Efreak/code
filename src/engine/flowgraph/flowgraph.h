* Sauerbraten Flowgraph Engine
* https://github.com/sauerbraten-fork
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Flowgraphs (also called flowcharts) are visual scripting enviroments
* which are easy and safe to use (they can also be used by rather unexperienced users)
* Whereas two-dimensional flowgraphs are very common, 3D flowgraphs are the exception.
* This projects realises a 3D flowgraph visual scripting engine for Cube2 Sauerbraten/Sauerfork
* I try to keep my code as clear as Hanacks code.
