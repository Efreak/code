///// GENERAL:
///
/// Inexors routine of loading and storing ingame-textures depends on 3 structures:
/// VSlot       - A Structure holding general info about scale, shadersettings, rotation, ..
/// Slot        - Basicly thats a "Texture" as you would find it ingame in the texturebrowser.
///               It consists of minimum 1 image (the diffuse-file) and various others providing special info (height,..).
///               Every Slot has a VSlot. (and vice versa: every VSlot has at least one Slot)
/// textureset  - A Set of textures/Slots to make loading easier and asynchronous.
///
/// The currently visible stack of ingame-textures (Slots) is vector<Slot *> slots.
